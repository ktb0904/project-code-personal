    <p class="home-text">I would like to say thank you for taking the time to view my website. The pictures on this site are ones that I took from my last trip with my mother before she passed. With keeping to her privacy I didn't include any photos of her or myself. I wanted to share a few of our memories with you so people can learn to enjoy the time they have with their family and friends because you never know when it could end.</p>
    <p class="home-text">As a child we grew up being told that we would go to Disney World again but sadly it never happened until later on in my life. We went to Orlando once when I was still an infant, my brother was 3 years old, and my sister was nothing more than a thought. When I was in my early 20s, my mother decided that she was ready to go to Disney World. At this point in her life she had been through a lot and walking became hard for her. Once we arrived at Disney World we enjoyed all of the parks that it could provide us. My mother couldn't enjoy many of the rides because of what she was going through but she still had a great time. </p>
    <p class="home-text">During our time in Orlando my mother wanted to go and visit Gatorland because she always wanted to go. Gatorland was enjoyable and it was also a good day for my mother so she was able to walk more. The sun was out, the exotic birds where making noises that you may have never heard, and the sound of the alligators in the water swimming was near. We got to enjoy a show of a man doing tricks and they got the alligator in a position where anyone could come up and touch it. This was the first time I had ever touched an alligator in my life. </p>
    <p class="home-text"> When we finally finished our time at Disney World my mother decided to stay in Orlando for one more day and go to Universal Studios. The park had plenty of things to do even though my mother was in a chair most of the day. She enjoyed going to the Jurassic Park, Twister, Jaws and Harry Potter section of the park, since she enjoyed those films. Interesting enough the Jaws section in Universal was closed down 8 months after we had visited the park. My mother had passed only 3 months before the Jaws ride closed. Knowing my mother she would have been upset to have missed that ride since she has always loved the film Jaws. After a long week of Disney World, Gatorland, and Universal Studios we got to enjoy a long 10 hour drive back home. </p>
